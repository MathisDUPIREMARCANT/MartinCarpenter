        Martin was a carpenter with a passion for his craft. He lived on a small picturesque island surrounded by other beautiful islands.
        However, the inhabitants of these islands were often limited in their movements because of the lack of bridges between them.
        One day, Martin had a brilliant idea. He decided to use his carpentry skills to connect these islands with strong and safe bridges. 
        Martin immediately set to work, gathering his tools and wood, and began building his first bridge.
        After much hard work, the first bridge was finally completed. It was beautiful, and the people of the islands could finally get from one island to the other. 
        After this first achievement, Martin decided to build many more bridges for the islanders. 
        You are Martin's carpenter's apprentice, here are the instructions to help him build the bridges:
